# SeriousLand
My first repository on GitHub

This was my first Java project a game called SeriousLand

The  basic is that ous litle guys called SeriousLanders have different
changes. 
If we have a SeriousLander in most advanced stage between direction wind direction
and another SeriousLander he will change to the next stage.

The goal is try to get the most of SeriousLanders possible in Rondify stage (last stage).

This game can be played by two players

Wind directions ; north, south, east, west

All SeriousLanders stages:
- first stage
< second stage
c third stage
o fourth stage (final)
