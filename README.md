# SeriousLand
My first repository on GitHub

This was my first Java project, a game called SeriousLand

The basic idea is related with those things called SeriousLanders.
They have different stages (4)
If we have a SeriousLander in most advanced stage between direction wind direction
and another SeriousLander he will change to the next stage.

The goal is try to get the most of SeriousLanders possible in Rondify stage (last stage)
using wind direction has strategy.

This game can be played by two players

Wind directions ; north, south, east, west

All SeriousLanders stages:
- first stage
< second stage
c third stage
o fourth stage (final)
